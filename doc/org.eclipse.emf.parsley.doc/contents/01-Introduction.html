<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Emf Parsley is a lightweight framework that allows easy and quick development
of EMF-based Applications. It can be configured to use all kind of EMF persistence 
implementations (XMI, Teneo, CDO).
</p>
<p>
It aims at providing a set of Components like Trees, Tables and Detail Forms 
that manage the model with the introspective EMF capabilities. 
Using these components you can easily build forms, viewer or editors. 
The framework provides basic UI implementations which are customizable 
with Injection mechanism
(based on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice">Google Guice</a>). 
</p>
<p>
You can use <em>Emf Parsley</em> basically in 2 ways the easy and the hard one!

<h2>Customizations: the Easy way</h2>
<p>
The framework provides a DSL that allows to customize the most relevant behaviors.
You can use the DSL by creating a new project with the wizard "Create a new project" -&gt; "EMF Parsley DSL Based project"

Clicking the "Finish" button the wizard will open directly the dsl editor. You can use the content assistant
to discover all features.

<h2>Customizations: the Hard way</h2>
<p>
If you need a deeper degree of customizations, you can use the injection mechanism based on Google Guice.
The framework has been designed for being completly customized in every detail. All you need to do is provide a custom
implementation for a class that implements a specific aspect; then you need to write the corresponding
<em>bind</em> method to tell the dependency injection mechanism to use your own custom class.
You can use the Java editor content assist to discover all bindings.
