<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
<em>EMF Parsley</em> is a lightweight framework that allows easy and quick UI development based
upon EMF. <em>EMF Parsley</em> is built on top of the EMF Edit framework and it implements features like Trees, Forms and Table builders with
standard JFace databinding, providing a complete component-based toolset.
EMF Parsley can be configured to use all kinds of EMF persistence
implementations (XMI, Teneo, CDO) 
Moreover a DSL allows to easily customize several behaviors in each component.

<h2>Parsley Components</h2>
<p>
<em>EMF Parsley</em> aims to provide a complete set of components to visualize your model with the introspective EMF capabilities
and can be used to easily build forms, viewers or editors. 
</p>
<p>
There are some components that can be used out-of-the-box and can be considered as a reference implementation
of the mechanisms that are the basis of <em>EMF Parsley</em> itslef. 
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>Trees</em> 
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Forms</em> 
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Tables</em> 
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Editors</em> 
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Search boxes</em> coming soon
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Customize</h2>
<p>
The main feature of <em>EMF Parsley</em> is that you can customize all basic UI behaviours of the components with <em>Dependency Injection</em>
mechanisms (based on <a href="https://github.com/google/guice">Google Guice</a>).
You can get more info in the <a href="06-Customization.html#Customizations" title="Go to &quot;Customizations&quot;">Customizations Section</a>, but you don&apos;t have to know all details
about the internal implementation to inject your own customization because
<em>EMF Parsley</em> provides a DSL to easy customize your UI, as explained in the next section.
</p>

<h3>Customize with the DSL</h3>
<p>
You can use the DSL by creating a new project with the wizard "Create a new project" -&gt; "EMF Parsley DSL Based project"
</p>
<p>
<div class="image" >
<img src="images/01-new-project-dsl-wizard.png" class=" " 
/>
<div class="caption">
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>
Clicking the "Finish" button the wizard will open directly the DSL editor. You can use the content assistant
to discover all features.
</p>
<p>
<div class="image" >
<img src="images/01-dsl-content-assistant.png" class=" "

</div>
</p>
<p>
The DSL allows to customize the most relevant behaviors, currently the following are permitted:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<em>parts</em> lets you define your View Parts: a file <em>plugin.xml_emfparsley_gen</em> will be generated
			that is meant to be synchronized with your own <em>plugin.xml</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>bindings</em> section lets you define which implementation will be used with Injection
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>menu</em> section lets you define the contextual menu for all viewers (<em>trees</em> and <em>tables</em>)
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>features provider</em> is used to retrieve the list of feature for a given EClass to build <em>tables</em>
			and <em>forms</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>viewer content provider</em> mediates between the viewer&apos;s model and the viewer, to provide the
			contents to be shown
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Label Provider</em> is used to retrieve the image and text rapresentation of the objects of a
			tree viewer
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Caption Provider</em> provides captions for each feature (namely, EStructuredFeature) of the object shown in a form,
			in a dialog or in a table row. 
			Different implementations can be defined for <em>dialogs</em>, <em>forms</em> and <em>tables</em>.
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Control Factory</em> provides a custom implementation of the Controls for each feature shown in a form or a dialog. 
			Different implementations can be defined forfor <em>dialogs</em> and <em>forms</em>
	</li>
</ul>
