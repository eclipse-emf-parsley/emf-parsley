===========================

Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description:
--------------------

EMF Parsley is an Eclipse project that provides a set of reusable UI components based on EMF (e.g., trees, tables, forms, views and editors), hiding most of the complexity of internal details, that can be used in your EMF-based plugin out-of-the-box. These parts are highly customizable via a DSL that let change a lot of details even easier and in a very compact form. The DSL is implemented in Xtext, thus, it comes with rich and powerful IDE tooling.
