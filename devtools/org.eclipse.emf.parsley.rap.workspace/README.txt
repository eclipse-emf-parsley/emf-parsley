This feature project is used only to materialize the workspace
for developers and contributors: it depends on all the features
and bundles that must be imported in the workspace so that we
can simply include this as a dependency in the Oomph setup file.

Note the included plugins for dragging into the Modular target also
log4j and slf4j. Otherwise, the RAP application won't start.
