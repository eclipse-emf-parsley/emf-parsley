# Eclipse EMF Parsley

Eclipse EMF Parsley is an Eclipse project that provides a set of reusable UI
components based on EMF (e.g., trees, tables, forms, views and editors), hiding
most of the complexity of internal details, that can be used in your EMF-based
plugin out-of-the-box. These parts are highly customizable via a DSL that let
change a lot of details even easier and in a very compact form. The DSL is
implemented in Xtext, thus, it comes with rich and powerful IDE tooling.
