This will be used only to test that we can build the RAP examples, using the target platform
example project that we provide, org.eclipse.emf.parsley.examples.rap.targetplatform.
In this project we create a test .target file that points to the p2 repository that has
been created during the Tycho build (using the rap profile).

The .target file in this project will be created during the Tycho build and will not be
put in the git repository.
